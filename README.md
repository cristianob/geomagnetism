$ npm install @cristianob/geomagnetism --save
```

### Usage

```js
const geomagnetism = require('@cristianob/geomagnetism');

// information for "right now"
const info = geomagnetism.model().point([44.53461, -109.05572]);
console.log('declination:', info.decl);

// use a specific date
const model = geomagnetism.model(new Date('12/25/2017'));
const info = model.point([44.53461, -109.05572]);
console.log('declination:', info.decl);
